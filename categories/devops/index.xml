      <description>Kubcolor is a thin wrapper over the kubectl command that adds coloring to the output.&#xA;I cloned the project and started maintaining it back in 2022 when the original author wasn&amp;rsquo;t active anymore.&#xA;KubeColor can reformats the output of most kubectl commands to add colors and clarity. It makes it so easier to read the output that I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand that it&amp;rsquo;s not more widely used. I actually gave a lightning talk about it at the KubeCon&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Native Reject Europe 2024 in Paris if you want a video pitch.</description>

      <description>So, a year and a half ago, I wrote Playing with Crossplane, for real blog post (link to the Medium original version).&#xA;This blog post was relating a real POC I did for my company, where I was pushing for using ArgoCD and Crossplane to handle our infrastructure in place of Terraform.&#xA;As you may have read, the outcome wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I thought.&#xA;I got contacted by Crossplane CEO, who shared my blog post to the Upbound team.</description>
