      <description>Kubcolor is a thin wrapper over the kubectl command that adds coloring to the output.&#xA;I cloned the project and started maintaining it back in 2022 when the original author wasn&amp;rsquo;t active anymore.&#xA;KubeColor can reformats the output of most kubectl commands to add colors and clarity. It makes it so easier to read the output that I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand that it&amp;rsquo;s not more widely used. I actually gave a lightning talk about it at the KubeCon&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Native Reject Europe 2024 in Paris if you want a video pitch.</description>

      <description>So, a year and a half ago, I wrote Playing with Crossplane, for real blog post (link to the Medium original version).&#xA;This blog post was relating a real POC I did for my company, where I was pushing for using ArgoCD and Crossplane to handle our infrastructure in place of Terraform.&#xA;As you may have read, the outcome wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I thought.&#xA;I got contacted by Crossplane CEO, who shared my blog post to the Upbound team.</description>

      <description>It’s 2022 ! We all know about the necessity of creating your Infra AS CODE. I guess we can all agree that Terraform (TF) is the leader in this field.&#xA;that said, TF is far from easy to use. This is actually not the fault of TF itself (or its parent company, Hashicorp), but to the fact that each provider is so specific that it’s impossible to build up something clean out of it.</description>
