      <description>So, a year and a half ago, I wrote Playing with Crossplane, for real blog post (link to the Medium original version).&#xA;This blog post was relating a real POC I did for my company, where I was pushing for using ArgoCD and Crossplane to handle our infrastructure in place of Terraform.&#xA;As you may have read, the outcome wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I thought.&#xA;I got contacted by Crossplane CEO, who shared my blog post to the Upbound team.</description>

      <description>It’s 2022 ! We all know about the necessity of creating your Infra AS CODE. I guess we can all agree that Terraform (TF) is the leader in this field.&#xA;that said, TF is far from easy to use. This is actually not the fault of TF itself (or its parent company, Hashicorp), but to the fact that each provider is so specific that it’s impossible to build up something clean out of it.</description>
